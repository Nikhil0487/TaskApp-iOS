# TaskApp-iOS

This is a DIY personal task manager app. This app is Work-In-Progress.
I track my tasks in a spreadsheet with manually entering dates and tasks everyday.
This app is designed to model the spreadsheet design I use as I couldn't find any
apps in App Store doing this.

## App Design

Initial Design:
- [ ] Date picker to select date. Beginner friendly and simple design,
- [ ] Table View for adding and deleting tasks
- [ ] Selecting a task should lead to sub tasks
- [ ] For now, UserDefaults is used as a database for MVP reasons. 
- [ ] Cloud backed database can replace UserDefaults later
- [ ] Interesting idea: Can nearby Apple devices update themselves using Core Bluetooth?
